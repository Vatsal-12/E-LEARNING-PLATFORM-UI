## Overview

This project is a responsive, multi-page E-Learning platform UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore listed courses, view embedded learning videos, and track their learning progress interactively. The entire design features a light pastel lilac color theme to provide a soft and modern user experience.

This platform simulates how a real e-learning website works on the frontend and is suitable for educational demos, frontend practice, or as a beginner’s portfolio project.

## Features

### 1. Course Listing (Home Page)
- Displays three beginner-level courses:
  - HTML & CSS Basics
  - JavaScript Essentials
  - Python for Beginners
- Each course is presented in a stylish card format with a brief description and a "View Course" button linking to a dedicated course detail page.

### 2. Course Detail Page
- Each course has its own separate HTML page to display:
  - Course title & description
  - An embedded YouTube video relevant to the course
  - A "Mark as Completed" button to track progress using localStorage

### 3. Progress Tracking
- The Progress page (`progress.html`) displays the completion status of all listed courses.
- When a user marks a course as completed, this progress is saved in the browser’s localStorage, and the status is updated across page reloads or new sessions.

## Tools & Technologies Used

### Languages
- HTML5: Structure and content for all pages.
- CSS3: Styling, responsiveness, and theme design.
- JavaScript (ES6): Minimal DOM manipulation and use of localStorage for persistent progress tracking.

### Other Tools
- Google Fonts (Poppins): For clean, modern typography.
- YouTube Embed API: To embed learning videos into course detail pages.
- LocalStorage API: To store and retrieve course completion status on the client side without a backend.

## Design & Theme

- Color Scheme: Light Lilac Theme
  - Background: #E6E6FA (Lilac)
  - Text: #4B0082 (Dark Purple)
  - Buttons/Links: #9370DB (Medium Purple)
  - Cards/Nav: White (#FFFFFF) with soft lilac shadows.
- Typography: Clean sans-serif (Poppins)
- User Experience: Simple, intuitive, and minimal distractions for an easy learning environment.


## Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

- Backend integration to store progress across devices.
- User login & authentication.
- Course search/filtering.
- Mobile-optimized version using media queries or Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS.
- Dynamic course loading via JavaScript JSON or APIs.
